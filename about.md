# About

I'm a senior studying electrical engineering at MIT. 
Currently, I'm working both as a Lab Assistant for the Introductory Circuits class (6.002),
and as an Undergraduate Researcher with the Responsive Environments Group at the MIT Media Lab.
Within electrical engineering, I am particularly interested in embedded systems and firmware architecure, as well as signals and systems.


I have experience working with Verilog, Assembly, C, MATLAB, Python, PureData, SPICE, and LaTeX.

I am proficient in Spanish and am learning Russian.
