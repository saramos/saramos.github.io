# About

![](FullSizeRender.jpg){:height="30%" width="30%"}

I'm a senior studying electrical engineering at MIT. 
Currently, I'm working both as a Lab Assistant for the Introductory Circuits class (6.002),
and as an Undergraduate Researcher with the Responsive Environments Group at the MIT Media Lab.
Within electrical engineering, I am particularly interested in embedded systems and firmware architecure, as well as signal processing.
I also have an interest in probability and stochastics.

Balance between my technical work and my creative outlets is extremely important to me.
Before high school, I attended an arts school for five years studying media art, visual art, music, and theater.
Since then, I've made sure to make art a priority in my life.
I played piano and alto saxophone before college, and am improving my music knowledge and skills through both acapella and music classes.

I have experience working with Verilog, Assembly, C, MATLAB, Python, PureData, SPICE, and LaTeX.

I am proficient in Spanish and am learning Russian.
